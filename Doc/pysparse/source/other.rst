Other Sparse Matrix Packages for Python
=======================================

- `Scipy <http://www.scipy.org>`_ provides a sparse matrix module featuring
  several storage formats. In the near future, we intend to provide speed and
  memory consumption comparisons between Pysparse and the Scipy formats.
- `CVXOPT <http://abel.ee.ucla.edu/cvxopt>`_ is a package for convex
  optimization and allows creation and manipulation of sparse matrices in
  compressed sparse row format.
